why, hello there

do this thing

what you should do:





edit the typer.py file to have your path in it (((it's not too long, it says [your path here] somewhere)))

then, run 'update-words.py'

then, you should be able to run typer.py from the command line with the text after it

it contains all pu words, some interpunction, and some ku suli words

if you want to add more words or puncutation characters: What you should do is this: add the word you want in sitelen Lasina to the 'word names' file, and then, on the same place relative to the other words in sitelen pona, add the ascii thing. You can use six lines, starting at a number ending in a 9 and ending at a number ending in a 4. I personally only used the top line for either _ or .    so if you want to keep my style, do that as well, but you're also free to ignore that or just remake everything, of course





possible things:

__ ~ a linebreak

_ ~ a whitespace

, ~ a centered period

: ~ a colon

{ ~ beginning of a cartouche

} ~ ending of a cartouche

all non-synonym pu-words

both ale and ali

kijetesantakalu

kin

ku

leko

misikeke

monsuta

soko

tonsi






hope you enjoy :3
