why, hello there
do this thing
what you should do:

edit the typer.py file to have your path in it (((it's not too long, it says [your path here] somewhere)))
then, run 'update-words.py'
then, you should be able to run typer.py from the command line with the text after it
it contains all pu words, no synonyms, no ali (yet)
also, no space. I have that on my personal thing on my computer, but I added it manually. I'll update it later, but it's quite simple to do yourself if you want. What you should do is this: add '_' (or whatever you want as your space) to the 'word names' file, and then add just spaces in the ascii-art file. on the same place relative to the other words. just like that you can also add other things if you want. If you end up adding a space, make sure to actually put spaces in those lines. the more you do, the wider your spaces will be

hope you enjoy :3
